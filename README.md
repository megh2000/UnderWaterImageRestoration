# UnderWaterImageRestoration

Images captured underwater will suffer from reduced contrast and degradation because of oceanic color and optical properties. This project focused on applying deep learning techniques to restore these underwater images. Our part of the work was to perform a learning based estimation of attenuation coefficients to restore underwater images.
